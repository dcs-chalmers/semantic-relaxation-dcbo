# Data structure description

The WFQ d-CBO (d-Choice Balanced Operations) queue uses the choice of d to balance enqueue and dequeue counts across several sub-queues, using internal counters to approximate these operation counts. By compiling with `HEURISTIC=LENGTH`, you instead get the d-CBL, which balances sub-queue lengths instead of operation counts. The FAAArrayQueue is one of the simplest sub-queues based on FAA.

## Origin
