# Data structure description

The WFQ d-CBO (d-Choice Balanced Operations) queue uses the choice of d to balance enqueue and dequeue counts across several sub-queues, using internal counters to approximate these operation counts. By compiling with `HEURISTIC=LENGTH`, you instead get the d-CBL, which balances sub-queue lengths instead of operation counts. The MS (Michael-Scott) queue is the most foundational lock-free queue, based on a linked list, using compare-and-swap for synchronization, and is here used as sub-queue.
## Origin

To from the paper _Balanced Allocations over Efficient Queues: A Fast Relaxed FIFO Queue_, to be published in PPoPP 2025.
