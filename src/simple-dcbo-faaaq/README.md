# Data structure description

The FAAArrayQueue Simple d-CBO (d-Choice Balanced Operations) queue uses the choice of d to balance enqueue and dequeue counts across several sub-queues. By compiling with `HEURISTIC=LENGTH`, you instead get the d-CBL, which balances sub-queue lengths instead of operation counts. The Simple d-CBO uses external and exact counters for operation counts. The FAAArrayQueue is one of the simplest sub-queues based on FAA.
